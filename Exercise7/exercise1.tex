This modified encryption does not achieve CPA-security.
\(H(m)\) is only collision-resistant and doesn't have to hide the message \(m\). If \(H(m)\) leaks the message \(m\) and this is concatenated with \(Enc(k, m)\) the resulting scheme \(Enc'(k, m)\) can't be CPA-secure. 
%Here $H(m)$ will not be random for every encryption because Hash is 
%calculated only based on message. As an Adversary against CPA
%has access to encryption oracle, Adversary can atleast distuinguish correspoding 
%cipher to a message just by comparing the appended $H(m)$ part in the cipher. Hence this 
%new modified encryption doesnt have indistingushable enryptions and so not
%CPA secure.
