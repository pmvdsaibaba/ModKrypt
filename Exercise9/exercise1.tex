\begin{itemize}
    \item [(a)] Proof by reduction:
Lets assume efficient adversary, $A$, against $f$, i.e, it breaks one wayness of
the function i.e., $A$ could invert the $f(x)$ with a non negligible probability.
So $A$ could find $x'$ such that $f(x') = f(x)$


Now contrust an adversary, $A'$, against hardcore bit, $h$, using $A$. So $A'$
could find $h(x')$ using $A$ capability to find $x'$ from $f(x')$. And so could find $h(x)= h(x')$ 
in a PPT with a non negligible probability. But this is contradiction to our assumption,
as for hardcore bit it is not possible to find $h(x)$ with a 
non negligible probability. Hence such $A$ doesnt exists. Hence this contrunction is secure.

    \item [(b)] Let $f$ be a constant function and $h$ be most significant bit, $msb(x)$.
  For this function it is hard for an Adversary to compute $h(x)$ from $f(x)$.
  Constant function is not a one way function. Because for constant function any value from domain
  as input to $f$ will be same as $f(x)$. Hence the above conclusion from (a) is not true 
  for a OWF
