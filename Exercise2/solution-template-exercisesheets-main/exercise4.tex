In this experiment the adversary A recieves a random message m* with its encryption c* from the challenger using the secret key (a, b). Adversary A now generates two messages m\(_{0}\) and m\(_{1}\) of the same length that must be distinct from m*. \\
Our challenger chooses one of them and encrypts them using the encryption scheme:
c = a  \(\cdot\) m\(_{b}\) + b \\
\\
To crack the encryption the adversary A has information about c*, m* and c. \\
That means adversary A has to solve these equations: \\
c* = a  \(\cdot\) m* + b \\
c = a  \(\cdot\) m\(_{b}\) + b \\
to get the secret key (a,b).\\
However since A is missing the information about m\(_{b}\) the system of equations is over-determined and not solvable. \\
This means A has to guess which message was encrypted and \\
Pr [TTP - SEC = 1] = \(\frac{1}{2}\) \\
