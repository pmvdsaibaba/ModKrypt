Decoded message: \\
ONE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE WITH CRYPTOGRAPHY NO AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE WILL EVER SOLVE A MATH PROBLEM \\

Using the XOR of both messages ( c1  \(\lxor\) c2 = (k  \(\lxor\) m1)  \(\lxor\) ((k  \(\lxor\) m2) = m1  \(\lxor\) m2 ) \\
we can decode the second message if we know the first. \\
Since we know one message starts with "ONE MUST " and contains " WITH " we get the start of the other message "OF VIOLEN" by reversing the XOR operation: \\
 (c1  \(\lxor\) c2)    \(\lxor\) m1 =  (m1  \(\lxor\) m2)  \(\lxor\) m2 = m2 \\
By guessing further letters from the context and finding the word " WITH " in one message we can decode the rest of the sentence. \\
