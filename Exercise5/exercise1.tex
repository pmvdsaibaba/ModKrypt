Given $ \{F_k\}_{k \in K} $ is a family of bit permutations.\\

Adversary $A$ can choose two inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$. Then the corresponding bit permutation with key $k$ be
$F_{k}(x_1)$ and $F_{k}(x_2)$.

Let's take an example, $F_k$ as the function that swaps the first two bits of its input.
For this function, the distinguisher can easily distinguish between $F_{k}(x_1)$ and $F_{k}(x_2)$
with a function, $f$ that also swaps first two bits of the output. Or this can also be easily 
distinguished just comparing the bits other than first two bits.

Similarly, for any such bit permutation function there exists a function $f$ which can easily distuingush the between the inputs
of a bit permutation $F_k$. Hence these family of bit permutations cannot be a pseudorandom permutation.
