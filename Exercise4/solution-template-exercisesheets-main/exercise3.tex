\textbf{Task:} Prove that indistinguishability of multiple encryptions in the presence of an eavesdropper does
not imply indistinguishability of encryptions under a chosen plaintext attack.\\
We show this by a proof by contradiction. Let's assume that an arbitrary encryption scheme \(\Pi = (Gen, Enc, Dec)\) exists, that is EAV-Mult secure.
